# **Infinite-2D-Jump-and-Run**
With a bit of help from AI, I built a continuous platform generator that creates an endless 2D jump & run experience — every playthrough offers new platform layouts, keeping the challenge fresh and fun.

**Features**

Procedural Platform Generation – Never the same level twice.

Smooth Player Movement – Run, jump, and navigate dynamically generated terrain.

Infinite Gameplay – Platforms spawn continuously as you progress.

Replayability – New layouts and challenges every run.

Unity-powered – Built in Unity for fast iteration and clean visuals.
